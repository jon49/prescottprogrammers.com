title: February Meeting Recap
---

We met on Tuesday this time hoping to take advantage of the Cafe's nice space. Unfortunately they close early on Tuesdays. So we headed over to Denny's instead. In March we'll go back to our regular Thursdays and meet at Starbuck's at the Frontier Village.

We were few this last time but we enjoyed conversation on gaming, functional programming, CAD, and 3D printing!
