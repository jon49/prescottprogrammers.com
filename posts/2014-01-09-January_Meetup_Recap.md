title: January Meetup Recap
---

Seven of us showed up at the meet up this last Thursday. We had four new people show up. We met at *[Emmanuel's Cafe and Bakery](http://www.emmanuelcafe.com/)* with roaring music in the background. Many people showed an interest in continuing to meet in Prescott Valley @ Emmanuel's. So, this next month we will meet on a Tuesday instead, again at Emmanuel's.

Dan brought his new [Oculus Rift](http://www.oculusvr.com/) to show us. All I got to say is don't stand up while viewing! It puts you a little off balance. Dan also brought some new toys he made with his new 3D printer!

Great conversation and company. Hope to see everyone again next month!
