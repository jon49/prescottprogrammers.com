<p>Seven of us showed up at the meet up this last Thursday. We had four new people show up. We met at <em><a href="http://www.emmanuelcafe.com/">Emmanuel’s Cafe and Bakery</a></em> with roaring music in the background. Many people showed an interest in continuing to meet in Prescott Valley @ Emmanuel’s. So, this next month we will meet on a Tuesday instead, again at Emmanuel’s.</p>
<p>Dan brought his new <a href="http://www.oculusvr.com/">Oculus Rift</a> to show us. All I got to say is don’t stand up while viewing! It puts you a little off balance. Dan also brought some new toys he made with his new 3D printer!</p>
<p>Great conversation and company. Hope to see everyone again next month!</p>
